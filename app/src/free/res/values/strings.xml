<!--need to define these separately in each flavor, free/paid as the manifest declares each
provider name to be this and to align I declare the URI in foodContract to be the applicationID
which will match the below strings for each flavor. I wonder if I can just declare in the
'shared' manifest the authority name to be flavorless (ie not contain free or paid) and then
just define it in foodContract as well and not have to do this?-->
